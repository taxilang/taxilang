description: Working with OpenAPI and Taxi
---

While you can use Taxi to describe full HTTP services, it's more common to define
a series of types in a standalone taxi project, then embed metadata in existing OpenAPI specs.

## Embedding Taxi metadata in OpenApi
You can embed Taxi metadata inside OpenApi docs, using the `x-taxi-type` extension.

### Describing models

You can embed references to Taxi metadata using the `x-taxi-type` extension in schema declarations within an OpenAPI spec.

Here's a simple example adding a reference to a Taxi model in a response object:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
   Person:
     x-taxi-type:
       name: org.people.Person #  <-- This model is of type org.example.Person
   type: object
   properties:
     # ... declaration continues ...
```

The above OpenAPI spec is the equivalent of this taxi snippet:

```taxi
namespace org.people

model Person
```

Model attributes can also be annotated with their corresponding taxi types:


```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      x-taxi-type:
        name: org.people.Person #  <-- This model is of type org.example.Person
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.people.PersonId # <-- Declares that this attribute is of type org.people.PersonId
```

This is the equivalent of the following taxi snippet:

```taxi
namespace org.people {
   // Typically defined elsewhere.
   type PersonId inherits Strings

   model Person {
      id : PersonId
   }
}
```

By default, Taxi's OpenAPI parser expects that types declared on model declarations (such as `org.people.PersonId` in this example) are references to an already defined types.
If the parser doesn't find the type, a compilation error is thrown.

Alternatively, you can instruct the parser that a type is being declared as a new type, as follows:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.people.PersonId
            create: true # <-- This type is being created by this schema for the first time.
```

#### The `create` attribute
As shown above, adding `create: true | false` to an `x-taxi-type` block instructs the parser whether a new
type is being declared.  If `false`, then it's expected that the type already exists, and the parser will
validate it's existence.

The default behaviour of create differs between models and their attributes.

**Models _are not_ expected to already exist in the schema.**

Adding `x-taxi-type` to a schema type in OpenAPI will create a new model type by default.
Add `create: false` to indicate that this model already should already exist, and to validate it's existence.

**Model attributes _are_ expected to already exist in the schema**

Adding `x-taxi-type` to a schema attribute in OpenAPI will expect a reference to an existing type.
Add `create: true` to indicate that this model doesn't already should already exist, and should be created


Here's a more complete example:
```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Swagger Petstore
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      x-taxi-type:
        name: org.people.Person #  <-- This model is of type org.example.Person
      properties:
        name:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.other.Name
          type: string
        dob:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.people.DateOfBirth
            create: true
          type: string
          format: date
        address:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.other.Address
          properties:
            street:
              type: string
        job:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.people.Career
          properties:
            title:
              type: string
paths: {}
```
generates
```
namespace org.people {

   type DateOfBirth inherits Date

   model Career {
      title : String?
   }

   model Person {
      name : org.other.Name?
      dob : DateOfBirth?
      address : org.other.Address?
      job : Career?
   }
}
```




### Describing services

#### Annotating an http method
```yaml
/people:
  get:
    responses:
      '200':
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                x-taxi-type:
                  name: org.other.Person # <-- The name of a return type declared inline
                type: object
                properties:
                  name:
                    x-taxi-type:
                      name: Name
                    type: string
```

Is the equivalent of:

```taxi
model Person {
   name: Name inherits String  // Name type declared inline.
}

service PeopleService {
   @HttpOperation(method = "GET" , url = "/people")
   operation GetPeople(  ) : Person[]
}
```

#### Annotating inputs

```yaml
/people/{id}:
  get:
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: PersonId # <-- The path variable of id is of type PersonId
          type: string
```

This is the equivalent of the following snippet:

```taxi
type PersonId inherits String

service PeopleIdService {
   @HttpOperation(method = "GET" , url = "/people/{id}")
   operation GetPeopleId( @PathVariable id : PersonId )
}
```

### More examples and reading
The `x-taxi-type` extension can be applied in both `json` and `yaml` OpenAPI
specification documents. For example:
[OpenAPI JSON specification with `x-taxi-type`](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/raw/master/swagger2taxi/src/test/resources/openApiSpec/v3.0/petstore-expanded-x-taxi-types.json)
[OpenAPI YAML specification with `x-taxi-type`](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/raw/master/swagger2taxi/src/test/resources/openApiSpec/v3.0/petstore-expanded-x-taxi-types.yaml)
[Resulting generated taxi](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/raw/master/swagger2taxi/src/test/resources/openApiSpec/v3.0/petstore-expanded-x-taxi-types.taxi)


#### Specification



* Any OpenAPI schema object *may* contain an `x-taxi-type` object at the top
level
* An `x-taxi-type` object *must* contain a `name` property of type `string`
* If the value of the name is unqualified, the generator considers it to be in
the default namespace provided as an argument to `generateAsStrings`
* The generator will use that name as the name of the type in preference to the
name the generator would otherwise have generated.
* An `x-taxi-type` object *may* contain a `create` property of type `boolean`
* The `create` property defaults to true if the schema would generate a `model`
(i.e., it either has properties or is composed via an `allOf`)
* The `create` property defaults to false if the schema would generate a `type`
(i.e., it neither has properties nor is composed via an `allOf`)

#### Examples

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Swagger Petstore
components:
  schemas:
    Person:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.other.Name
          type: string
        dob:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: DateOfBirth
            create: true
          type: string
          format: date
        address:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: org.other.Address
            create: false
          properties:
            street:
              type: string
        job:
          x-taxi-type:
            name: Career
          properties:
            title:
              type: string
paths: {}
```
generates
```
namespace orbital.openApi {

   type DateOfBirth inherits Date

   model Career {
      title : String?
   }

   model Person {
      name : org.other.Name?
      dob : DateOfBirth?
      address : org.other.Address?
      job : Career?
   }
}
```


## Converting an OpenAPI spec to Taxi, using code

It's possible to convert a swagger document to Taxi, using the `TaxiGenerator` from the `openApi` package.

This is especially useful if you want to take advantage of Taxi's type extensions, to mix in annotations.  (eg., persistence or validation).

Grab the taxi generator from maven:

```text
<dependency>
  <groupId>lang.taxi</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger2taxi</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then run the converter as follows:

This example loads source from [this reference example](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/raw/master/swagger2taxi/src/test/resources/openApiSpec/v2.0/yaml/petstore-simple.yaml) from the OpenApi project.

```kotlin
// The actual swagger source is omitted for brevity
val source = IOUtils.toString(URI.create("https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/raw/master/swagger2taxi/src/test/resources/openApiSpec/v2.0/yaml/petstore-simple.yaml"))
TaxiGenerator().generateAsStrings(source, "orbital.openApi")
```

```taxi
// generated:
namespace orbital.openApi  {

   model NewPet {
      name : String
      tag : String?
   }

   model Pet inherits NewPet {
      id : Int
   }

   model ErrorModel {
      code : Int
      message : String
   }

   service PetsService {
      [[ Returns all pets from the system that the user has access to ]]
      @HttpOperation(method = "GET" , url = "http://petstore.swagger.io/api/pets")
      operation findPets(  tags : String,  limit : Int ) : Pet[]
      [[ Creates a new pet in the store.  Duplicates are allowed ]]
      @HttpOperation(method = "POST" , url = "http://petstore.swagger.io/api/pets")
      operation addPet( @RequestBody pet : NewPet ) : Pet
   }
   service PetsIdService {
      [[ Returns a user based on a single ID, if the user does not have access to the pet ]]
      @HttpOperation(method = "GET" , url = "http://petstore.swagger.io/api/pets/{id}")
      operation findPetById( @PathVariable(value = "id") id : Int ) : Pet
      [[ deletes a single pet based on the ID supplied ]]
      @HttpOperation(method = "DELETE" , url = "http://petstore.swagger.io/api/pets/{id}")
      operation deletePet( @PathVariable(value = "id") id : Int )
   }
}
```

## Considerations around nullability
OpenApi has different ways of expressing nullability on attributes

 * required attributes present on a model
 * the nullable attribute of a field definition (where nullable is false by default)

The Taxi processor applies the following order of precedence to determine nullability:

 * Does the model specify required attributes?
* If so, is this field declared as required?
* Yes -> field is not nullable
* No -> field is nullable
 * Is the attribute defined as nullable?
* Yes -> field is nullable
* No -> field is not nullable
