## Taxi projects and files
A Taxi project contains a `taxi.conf` file, and a collection of files saved with a `.taxi.` extension.

A typical project might look like this:
```text
.
├── src/
│   └── sample.taxi
├── tests/
│   └── hello-world/
│       ├── hello-world.spec.json
│       ├── input.csv
│       └── expected-output.json
└── taxi.conf
```

Taxi files are simple text files, saved with a `.taxi` extension.

An overview of the `taxi.conf` file is provided here TODO.

## Taxi Doc

All elements in taxi can be documented using taxidoc - which is simply markdown, wrapped in a `[[` and `]]`

```text
[[
This is some documentation.
Any [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is valid
]]
type TaxiDocExample
```
Most things within Taxi can be documented with Taxi doc, including:

* Types and models
* Fields in types
* Enums and their values
* Services and operations

## Comments
Comments can appear anywhere in a taxi file.  There are two flavours of comments, multiline (`/* ... */`) and single line (`//`):

```taxi

/*
You can declare multiline comments anywhere.
Anything inside this block is a comment
*/

// alternatively, you can have single line comments.
// Of course, you can have lots of single line comments too.

```
## Namespaces
Like in most languages, things in Taxi (types, services, operations, etc) need to have a unique name.


To help prevent name clashes, Taxi uses namespaces - simply a way of disambiguating between two things with the same name.

```taxi
namespace customers

type Name inherits String // The fully qualified name is customers.Name

```

Namespaces can be declared in two ways.

#### Single namespace files
If everything in a single file belongs to the same namespace, simply add `namespace xxx` at the top of the file.
Everything that is declared in the file becomes part of the namespace.

```taxi
namespace customers

type Name inherits String // The fully qualified name is customers.Name
```
#### Multi-namespace files
If you have multiple namespaces within the same file, you can define namespaces using curly brace syntax:

```taxi
namespace people {
    // fullyQualifiedName is people.Name
    type Name inherits String
}
namepace pets {
    // fullyQualifiedName is pets.Name
    type Name inherits String
}
```

<Hint type="Convention">
    Namespaces typically start with lower-case letters.
    
    <Prefer>namespace people</Prefer>
    <Discourage>namespace People</Discourage>
</Hint>
<Hint type="Convention">
    Where there's a choice between singular and plural, prefer naming namespaces after plurals
    
    <Prefer>namespace people</Prefer>
    <Discourage>namespace person</Discourage>
</Hint>

## Imports
Imports are a way of including a type declared in another file.
When a type or model is imported, it can be referenced using it's name, rather than requiring the fully qualified name.

Imports come before a namespace declaration.


```taxi
import people.Name

namespace customers 

// The same as type customers.CustomerFirstName inherits people.Name
type CustomerFirstName inherits Name
```
