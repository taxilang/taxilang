Welcome! 👋 Taxi is a language for documenting APIs - the models they return, and the operations they can perform.

![](https://img.shields.io/bintray/v/taxi-lang/releases/parent?label=Taxi&style=for-the-badge)

As a language, Taxi focuses on:

* **Readability**  - A familiar syntax that should be easy to write, and easy to understand.
* **Expressiveness** - Taxi should be able to describe the semantic meaning of your data, and rich quirky contracts of our APIs
* **Typesafe** - A strongly typed, expressive language, purpose-built for describing API operations & types
* **Tooling** - Taxi is intended to allow next-generation tooling integration - the syntax allows rich expression of what services can do \(rather than just where to find them\).
* **Extensibility** - Taxi allows you to refine and compose API schemas, adding context, annotations, and improving type signatures.

Taxi is used heavily to power [Vyne](https://vyne.co) - and the projects have influenced each other & evolved together.    The expressiveness of Taxi allows Vyne to automate integration between services.

However, Taxi is intended to be a standalone tool, and is not coupled to Vyne.  There's lots of amazing things you can do with Taxi on it's own.

## New to Taxi or Vyne?

It's easy to adopt Taxi incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as Swagger or XML schemas) and migrate functionality at your convenience.

In fact, Taxi is designed to complement those tools, and you can happily use Swagger or Xsds are you base schema, and then overlay semantic data using Taxi.
