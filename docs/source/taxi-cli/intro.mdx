description: An overview of the `taxi` command line tool, and it's config
---


import {Hint} from "../components/hint"

The `taxi` command line tool provides access to the compiler - which validates the syntax of taxi projects  - and allows plugins of generators to create models and services in different languages and frameworks.

## Install

Taxi is distributed by [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).  If you haven't installed this yet, follow the instructions at [SDKMAN's installation page](https://sdkman.io/install).

Then simply run:

```
sdk i taxi
taxi
```

## Project overview

A typical taxi project will be laid out as follows:

```text
project/
├── src/
│   ├── someTypes.taxi
│   └── moreTypes.taxi
└── taxi.conf
```

## taxi.conf

A `taxi.conf` file describes a project's layout, and the plugins to be invoked after compilation.  It follows the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) format, which is like supercharged JSON.

Read more details about the Taxi.Conf file <Link to="/taxi-conf-file" rel="">here</Link>


## Plugins

Taxi's compiler and language generators are extensible and pluggable.

You can leverage our existing plugins to generate code, or author your own.  Read more about plugins <Link to="/plugins/README">here</Link>

## Command reference

### init

Creates a new taxi project, with a `taxi.conf` file, and the recommended layout.

```bash
$  taxi init
```

```bash
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
taxi init
```

You'll be prompted with basic project details to name and create your new taxi project

* Project group: `demo` ⏎
* Project name: `hello-world` ⏎
* Project version: ⏎  (Defaults are fine)
* Source directory:  ⏎ (Defaults are fine)

A new `taxi.conf` has now been created, as follows:

```text
name: demo/hello-world
version: 0.1.0
sourceRoot: src/
```

### build

Compile the taxi project, and invoke any language generators

```bash
taxi build
```

This command invokes the taxi compiler to validate your taxi code, and invokes any language generators configured.  (See <Link to="/plugins/README">Plugins</Link>).
If no plugins are configured, no code will be emitted, but the project is still compiled, ensuring no syntactic errors exist.

### version-bump

```bash
taxi version-bump major|minor|patch
```

This command increments the version defined in the `taxi.conf` file.

<Hint>

   Running this command will change the layout of your `taxi.conf` file, to follow HOCON layout.

   While there are no material differences between the files before and after, cosmetic changes can occur.  We're aware of this issue, and will address it in a future release.
</Hint>

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principals are followed when incrementing the version.

### set-version

```bash
taxi set-version $newVersion
```

This command updates the version defined in the `taxi.conf` with to `$newVersion`

eg:

```bash
$  taxi-hello-world taxi set-version 0.2.3
Taxi version 0.10.4
Version updated from 0.1.0 to 0.2.3
```

<Hint>

   Running this command will change the layout of your `taxi.conf` file, to follow HOCON layout.

   While there are no material differences between the files before and after, cosmetic changes can occur.
   We're aware of this issue, and will address it in a future release.
</Hint>


### publish

```bash
taxi publish
```

Publishes the current project to the repository defined in the `publishToRepository` of the `taxi.conf` file.

This involves creating a zip file from the current project, and uploading it to the configured repository.

When a project is published, only the following artifacts are added:

 * The `taxi.conf` file at the root of the project
 * All `*.taxi` files present in the configured `sourceRoot`

No other content is added.

eg:

```bash
$ taxi publish
Taxi Dev version @680c65b
Adding file /sample-project/taxi.conf
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-enum.taxi
Publishing package taxi/sample/0.3.0 from /tmp/sample-0.3.0.zip to http://localhost:8081/
Will attempt to publish to http://localhost:8081/repository/taxi/taxi/sample/0.3.0/sample-0.3.0.zip using basic auth credentials supplied
Artifact uploaded successfully
```

### orbital

```bash
taxi vyne
```

This command launches a local version of Orbital, configured to read the taxi project with live updates.

Orbital is automatically configured as described in [Building a standalone taxonomy](https://docs.vyne.co/developers-guide/setting-up-vyne-locally#building-a-standalone-taxonomy), with the following components:

 * The [Orbital UI](https://orbitalhq.com), which allows you to browse and search the taxonomy as you author
 * A local [schema server](https://docs.vyne.co/developers-guide/setting-up-vyne-locally#building-a-standalone-taxonomy), which will live-sync changes as you make them in your local filesystem.
 * A local [Cask](https://docs.vyne.co/casks/cask-server-1) (Vyne's lightweight persistence layer), in case you want to make some data queryable quickly

<Hint>

   This requires docker and docker-compose to be installed locally.

</Hint>

A `docker-compose.yml` file is created locally, configured to use `latest`.  You can override the version by passing
`--version` or `-v`. eg:

```bash
taxi vyne -v 0.14.0
```

Note that if a `docker-compose.yml` already exists, then it is not overridden.  You can change this by passing `-f` or `--force`.
