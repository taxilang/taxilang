[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/taxi-lang/releases/taxi-cli/images/download.svg) ](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/taxi-cli/target/taxi-cli.zip?job=publish-release)

The `taxi` command line tool provides access to the compiler - which validates the syntax of taxi projects - and allows plugins of generators to create models and services in different languages and frameworks.

## Getting started

To get started you need to download and install Taxi. Download
the [taxi.zip](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/taxi-cli/target/taxi-cli.zip?job=publish-release)
file and extract it.

The zip contains the files needed to run taxi, along with some scripts to make launching easier.

Once the file is downloaded and extracted, you need to add it to your path. It will look something like this:

```bash
/install-location/taxi/bin
```

Once the install location has been added to your path, test everything is up and running by invoking:

```bash
taxi
```

## Project overview

A typical taxi project will be laid out as follows:

```text
project/
├── src/
│   ├── someTypes.taxi
│   └── moreTypes.taxi
└── taxi.conf
```

## taxi.conf

A `taxi.conf` file describes a project's layout, and the plugins to be invoked after compilation. It follows the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) format, which is like supercharged JSON.

Read more details about the Taxi.Conf file <Link to="/taxi-conf-file" rel="">here</Link>

## Plugins

Taxi's compiler and language generators are extensible and pluggable.

You can leverage our existing plugins to generate code, or author your own. Read more about plugins <Link to="/plugins/README">here</Link>

## Command reference

### init

Creates a new taxi project, with a `taxi.conf` file, and the recommended layout.

```bash
$  taxi init
```

```bash
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
taxi init
```

You'll be prompted with basic project details to name and create your new taxi project

-  Project group: `demo` ⏎
-  Project name: `hello-world` ⏎
-  Project version: ⏎ (Defaults are fine)
-  Source directory: ⏎ (Defaults are fine)

A new `taxi.conf` has now been created, as follows:

```text
name: demo/hello-world
version: 0.1.0
sourceRoot: src/
```

### build

Compile the taxi project, and invoke any language generators

```bash
taxi build
```

This command invokes the taxi compiler to validate your taxi code, and invokes any language generators configured. (See <Link to="/plugins/README">Plugins</Link>).
If no plugins are configured, no code will be emitted, but the project is still compiled, ensuring no syntactic errors exist.

### version-bump

```bash
taxi version-bump major|minor|patch
```

This command increments the version defined in the `taxi.conf` file.

<Hint>
   Running this command will change the layout of your taxi.conf file, to follow
   HOCON layout.
   <br />
   <br />
   While there are no material differences between the files before and after, cosmetic
   changes can occur. We're aware of this issue, and will address it in a future
   release.
</Hint>

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principals are followed when incrementing the version.

### set-version

```bash
taxi set-version $newVersion
```

This command updates the version defined in the `taxi.conf` with to `$newVersion`

eg:

```bash
$  taxi-hello-world taxi set-version 0.2.3
Taxi version 0.10.4
Version updated from 0.1.0 to 0.2.3
```

<Hint>
   Running this command will change the layout of your taxi.conf file, to follow
   HOCON layout.

   changes can occur. We're aware of this issue, and will address it in a future
   release.
</Hint>

### publish

```bash
taxi publish
```

Publishes the current project to the repository defined in the `publishToRepository` of the `taxi.conf` file.

This involves creating a zip file from the current project, and uploading it to the configured repository.

When a project is published, only the following artifacts are added:

-  The `taxi.conf` file at the root of the project
-  All `*.taxi` files present in the configured `sourceRoot`

No other content is added.

eg:

```bash
$ taxi publish
Taxi Dev version @680c65b
Adding file /sample-project/taxi.conf
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-enum.taxi
Publishing package taxi/sample/0.3.0 from /tmp/sample-0.3.0.zip to http://localhost:8081/
Will attempt to publish to http://localhost:8081/repository/taxi/taxi/sample/0.3.0/sample-0.3.0.zip using basic auth credentials supplied
Artifact uploaded successfully
```
