TaxiHub is an upcoming project provides a place to share and distribute taxonomies and taxi plugins across your organisation.

<Hint>Taxi Hub is entirely optional, and not required for use of taxi.</Hint>

The code is available [here](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-hub).

<Discourage>
   Taxi Hub is a developing project. The code is being made visible to provide
   visibility into it's development, and allow organsiations to download and use
   early-access versions of it.
   <br />
   <br />
   However, Taxi Hub should be considered "Source Visible", and **not** "Open Source".
   We will revisit and clarify licensing of Taxi Hub at a later date.
