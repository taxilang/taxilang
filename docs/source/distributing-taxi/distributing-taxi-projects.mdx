Once built, Taxi project and plugins can be packaged and published to a repository to allow other projects to depend on them.

## Adding dependencies

Dependencies are defined in the `taxi.conf` project, in the `dependencies` section.
Here's an example:

```hocon
// Create a project in the acme organisation named "depends-on-sample"
name: acme/depends-on-sample
version: 0.3.0
sourceRoot: src/

dependencies: {
//   Depends on a project in the "acme" organisation called "sample", version 0.3.0
   acme/sample: 0.3.0
}
```

When running a `taxi build` command, the taxi-cli will first ensure that all dependent projects have been downloaded, and
are present in the local cache.

Adding a dependency requires you to specify the repository to download it from:

```
repositories: [
   {
      // The name of the repository.  Optional, but used to reference credentials
      name: "my-corporate-nexus",
      url: "http://localhost:8081",
      // Optional.  Defines the type of repository being used.  Currently only 'nexus' is supported,
      // so this can be omitted.
      type : "nexus",

      // Settings specific to the repository provider.
      // Below settings shown are applicable to a nexus repository
      settings: {
         // The name of the repository as defined within nexus
         repositoryName : taxi
      }
   }
]
```

For more details on how to define dependencies, and configure repositories to download them from, see <Link to="/taxi-cli/taxi-conf-file">here</Link>

<Hint>

If you're editing your `taxi.conf` file in VSCode using our plugin, saving changes to your `taxi.conf` will trigger the download of any dependencies.

However, be aware that where most other changes in VS Code take place as you type, downloading of dependencies requires you to save the file first.
</Hint>


## Publishing taxonomies

Projects are published by running the `taxi publish` command, from within the same directory that contains your `taxi.conf` file.

You must first configure a publishToRepository in your `taxi.conf` file:

```hocon
publishToRepository: {
   url: "http://localhost:8081/"
   name : "nexus"
   settings: {
      repositoryName : taxi
   }
}
```

Credentials can be stored elsewhere, following the rules for `taxi.conf` merging, as discussed <Link to="/taxi-cli/taxi-conf-file/#credentials">here</Link>.

Having configured a repository to publish to, running `taxi publish` from the directory with your `taxi.conf` file will trigger the deployment:

Here's a sample output:

```bash
$  taxi publish
Taxi version @22a6a51
Adding file /sample-project/taxi.conf
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-enum.taxi
Adding file /sample-project/src/sub-src/Test-C.taxi
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-D.taxi
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-B.taxi
Adding file /sample-project/src/Test-A.taxi
Publishing package taxi/sample/0.3.0 from /tmp/sample-0.3.0.zip to http://localhost:8081/
Will attempt to publish to http://localhost:8081//repository/taxi/taxi/sample/0.3.0/sample-0.3.0.zip using basic auth credentials supplied
Artifact uploaded successfully

```

## Sharing taxonomies with Nexus
Currently, [Sonatype Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus/repository-oss) is the best way to publish and share Taxi repositories.

This guide does not cover the basics of installing and getting Nexus running, and assumes you've already got a Nexus instance running somewhere.
However, for a quick getting started, you can always use the [Nexus Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3), as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir /some/dir/nexus-data && chown -R 200 /some/dir/nexus-data
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -v /some/dir/nexus-data:/nexus-data sonatype/nexus3
```

This will give you a local running nexus at `https://localhost:8081`.

### Creating a Taxi repository
In Nexus, Taxi repositories are defined as Raw repositories.

 * Log in to Nexus with admin credentials, and create a new repository.  From the list of repository types, select "raw (hosted)"
 * Give the repository a name.  This is the name that will be used in your repository config section in your taxi.conf file.
 * Configure the rest of the repository settings, including redeployment policies and blob store
 * Click "Create Repository"

#### Updating your taxi.conf file to publish
In the taxi.conf file of the project you wish to publish to your new repository, add the following:

```hocon
publishToRepository: {
   // This name is used to look up credentials for auth
   name: "my-corporate-nexus"
   // The base url of the nexus
   url: "http://localhost:8081/"
   settings: {
      // The name you assigned to your repository when creating it in nexus
      repositoryName: taxi-on-nexus
   }
}
```

If necessary, also add credentials - either in your projects `taxi.conf` file (not recommended), or on your system's
taxi.conf at `~/.taxi/taxi.conf`:

```
credentials: [
   {repositoryName: "my-corporate-nexus", username: "jimmy", password: "pass123"}
]
```

## Best practices for sharing taxonomies




## Other links
Publishing and sharing taxonomies is maturing within Taxi.  We currently only support a single repository (nexus), but can add support
as required for other repositories.

PR's are welcomed in this regard too.
