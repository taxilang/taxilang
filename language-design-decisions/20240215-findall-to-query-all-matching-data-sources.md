## Context and Problem Statement

`find { Foo }` used to include subtypes of `Foo` in the query graph.
However, this lead to inconsistent behaviour, as documented in [Find does not query on base types](./20240215-find-does-not-query-on-base-types.md).
So, the behaviour was removed.

Instead, "query for everything" should be an explicit, opt-in behaviour.

For this, we're proposing `findAll {}`


## Outstanding questions

### How are inputs to operations resolved?
eg:

```
model Trade { ... }
model FxTrade inherits Trade { ... }
model EquityTrade inherits Trade { ... }

service Trades {
   operation listFxTrades():FxTrade[]
   operation listFxTrades(TraderId):FxTrade[]

   operation listEquityTrades():EquityTrade[]
}
```

In the above, which services are expected to be invoked in the following query:

```
given { TraderId = '123' }
findAll { Trade[] }
```

Should `listEquityTrades()` be invoked?
