ISO currency codes are the three-letter alphabetic codes that represent the various [currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isocurrencycode.asp) used
throughout the world. When combined in pairs, they make up the symbols and [cross rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossrate.asp) used in currency
trading.

Each of the country-specific three-letter alphabetic codes also have a
corresponding three-digit numeric code. These codes are identified by the
[International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-organization-for-standardization-iso.asp) a nongovernmental organization
which provides standards for manufacturing, commerce, technology and communication.

For currencies, the governing document is called ISO [4217:2015](https://www.iso.org/standard/64758.html).

In the forex market, currency unit prices are quoted as currency pairs. The base currency – also
called the transaction currency - is the first currency appearing in a currency pair quotation,
followed by the second part of the quotation, called the quote currency or the counter currency.
For accounting purposes, a firm may use the base currency as the domestic currency or accounting currency
to represent all profits and losses.

## Breaking down Base Currency
In forex, the base currency represents how much of the quote currency is needed for you to get one unit of the base currency. For example, if you were looking at the CAD/USD currency pair, the Canadian dollar would be the base currency and the U.S. dollar would be the quote currency.

The quote currency, commonly known as "counter currency,"
is the second currency in both a direct and indirect currency pair and is used to
determine the value of the base currency. In a direct quote, the quote currency is the foreign currency,
while in an indirect quote, the quote currency is the domestic currency. Quote currency
is also referred to as the "secondary currency."

#### Key Takeaways
 * The quote currency, commonly known as "counter currency," is the second currency in both a direct and indirect currency pair and is used to value the base currency.
 * In a direct quote, the quote currency is the foreign currency, while in an indirect quote, the quote currency is the domestic currency.
 * As the rate in a currency pair increases, the value of the quote currency is falling, whether the pair is direct or indirect.
