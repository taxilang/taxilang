description: Reference documentation on functions provided in Taxi's StdLib packages
---

Taxi ships with a collections of functions for basic operations on data.

These operations are performed locally on data received from services - it does not instruct remote
services to perform these changes.

Taxi does not provide implementations of these functions, that's left to
runtimes, such as Orbital.
